This is a not-so-simple bot for Elite Dangerous, specifically designed with Aisling Duval in mind.
The overall objective is to primarily aquire information that would either be extensively difficult to aquire manually or technically impossible, and secondarily minimize the manual labor requirement of daily tasks.
This is done via several functions such as;

Sphere Calculations
  -plurality
  -theoretical
  -faction stability

Offensive Target Calculation
  -values calculated by distance, effort, and reward

Automated Sphere Scanning
  -internal (checking established sphere for changes above set arbitraty thresholds or pluirality risks)
  -external (mapping potential weapon spheres and uncontrolled border territories)
